LECTURE OVERVIEW:
What are APIs?
APIs are basically what we call as endpoints for using the application
We can use APIs to make requests: most common usecase.
Returns a JSON object, (which is a string) need to be parsed
We can also specify search queries and headers.

The entire process is made easier using axios

Axios: A library for making HTTP requests: 
APIs => They return just the data in Json/XML (mostly json)


PROJECT GOAL:
Okay so, we just type the name of the show and then
the API returns some data and then we use that
data to show the images (Since we are not using an ID),
multiple results will be returned. 

I want this to be interactive i.e, as the user types,
The responses update. When the user hasn't typed anything,
clear the page. So update accordinly.

I also want to design a nice interface for this project. (2nd Stage)


LET'S GET STARTED:
STEP 1: See what data is being returned from our movies API using Postman 

(Done)

STEP 2: Fetch Data using axios 

STEP 3: Parse Data to get all the images

STEP 4: Add logic for displaying and removing images

STEP 5: Debounce
Make a request only when a user is done typing / when he
hasn't typed for a certain time
